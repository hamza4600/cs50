Git is used for version controll IT manage the code and changes in the code we have  it also provide a method  the we can host a repo Online and our colllages can work along us with  the 
same code we also push cahnges on the repo and our collages can also get the changes many people can work on a smae code making the changing

we can also make changes to Code it we satisfay with the cahnges then we can add then to the orignal Repo 

we can also reverse back to old version of our code 
Mostaly used for large code Projects  
Github have a  alternative 

git clone <url> 
is used to clone a repo we wnat and content is also done 

git add 
is used to add fielto the server

git commit -m ""
used to add commite to the code or a file easy for us that we know the detils 
add new line  discription of code or files 

git status 
tell what happening in the repo 

git push
code is add to the repo 

git commit -am
add all files that are bering changed and provide a message

then type 
git push add all changes to the file in the server 

git pull 
means  get the changes in the code from the Git server  that are made an show in my local machine 

Merger Conflit 
mean that we are making chnageing in the code our collage is also making chnaging in the code but tha have an error both at the same time

git commit -am "Fix merge conflict"
then add 
git push 
the chnage that are made by two or more developrs are now Hosted on the server  code is updated 

git log
 it tell the histry or code who had made chnage the code who adde the code on what Date     

git reset 
 it tel and show the previous state of code 

git reset --hash 
    hard reset  the code to previous state 

Branching
    Is the Git way on working on the new Featurs On the App 
    when we devolp an App after continus add new developmnet the we wnat to add new featurs then we we will add new Branch that will hold rhe new featurs and then keep working on that 

tHEN WE WILL HAVE DIFFERNT bRANches on a repo having new feature and fixxing the Bugs  
after that new featur we can merge the change with new feature  

git branch 
show the current branch of repo 

git checkout -b name
     it will creat a new Branch wilth the name we enter then we will move to the branch and make chnages to the code will not affect the Master Branch

Example 
git commit -am "commites "
    add  new commites and remove the code iin the Branch 

git check master 
    move to word the master Branch 

git merge name of branch
    that changes  which are present in the BRanch will be add in the Master repo 
    It Often show the Merge Conflit 
    \

If we want to make changing to open source code then we need to fork the repo we can add contribution of code 

Fork mean a copy of repo 
after Fork we can ,add new featurn to the code then we will requet the repo and 
Pull request to the repo 
Aftre that Manin Contributer will see the changing and merger our code with the Master File 

That is hOw Open Source work all Contributer from all over World work on the same App'
